Window handling, faster and ergonomic alternative to winit but for Windows OS only

Currently in alpha phase, will be developed gradually, Issues are welcome.

The goal is to create a fast and ergonomic window/input handling library for video game development.

This means that only a portion of the functionality that the winit library has will be implemented, so you may not want to use this library for complex projects other than video games.

The only supported operating system is Windows, I plan to also support Linux.

NOTE: having removed this crate from one of my video games there is still the logic of the key mapping of the voxel game, it's something that needs to be redone.
